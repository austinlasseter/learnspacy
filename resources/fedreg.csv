2018-10583,We are superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2017-11-03 for DG Flugzeugbau GmbH Model DG-500MB gliders that are equipped with a Solo 2625 02 engine modified with a fuel injection system following the instructions of Solo Kleinmoteren GmbH Technische Mitteilung 4600-3 and identified as Solo 2625 02i. This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as failure of the connecting rod bearing resulting from too much load on the rod bearings from the engine control unit. This AD adds a model to the applicability. We are issuing this AD to require actions to address the unsafe condition on these products.
